Custom Hash Table Implementation in Python

This project implements a custom hash table called HashContainer in Python featuring dynamic resizing and collision resolution through chaining with a doubly linked list.
Features include a custom hash function using multiplication and division methods, collision resolution using chaining, dynamic resizing that grows when full and shrinks when 1/4 empty, and support for integer keys and values.
The HashContainer class includes methods for initialization, computing hashes, adjusting capacity, adding elements, deleting elements, finding elements, and getting element and bucket counts.
To use the HashContainer, import it and create an instance. You can add elements, find values by key, and delete elements as needed.
The script includes a basic test suite in the main section. Run the script to demonstrate operations and resizing functionality.
